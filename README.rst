Rundown
-------
This project isn't remarkable enough to make detailed explanations, so here is a short rundown:

ultrarapidlinks app handles creation and storage of user submited links, as well as redirection from the shortened versions of links to expected destination site.
Long story short, it's a shoddy bit.ly. Enjoy.
